## Introduction

U++ is a C++ cross-platform rapid application development framework focused on programmers productivity. It includes a set of libraries (GUI, SQL, Network, etc.), and an integrated development environment.

Rapid development is achieved by the [smart and aggressive use of C++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$overview$en-us.html) rather than through fancy code generators. In this respect, U++ competes with popular scripting languages while preserving C/C++ runtime characteristics.

The U++ integrated development environment, TheIDE, introduces modular concepts to C++ programming. It features BLITZ-build technology to speedup C++ rebuilds up to 4 times, Visual designers for U++ libraries, a [Topic++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/app$ide$Topic$en-us.html) system for documenting code and creating rich text resources for applications (like help and code documentation) and [Assist++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/app$ide$Assist$en-us.html) - a powerful C++ code analyzer that provides features like code completion, navigation and transformation.

TheIDE can work with GCC, Clang, MinGW and Visual C++ and contains a full featured debugger. TheIDE can also be used to develop non-U++ applications.

U++ supports following platforms on the production level: **Windows**, **macOS**, **GNU/Linux** & **FreeBSD**.

## What you can get with U++?

* A very effective C++ library for cross-platform development in source form.
* A good integrated development environment, designed for developing large C++ applications.

You can use both, or you can use whichever you need.

## License
U++ uses the BSD-2 Clause license. The license applies to all source code in this repository except for the situation when the directory contains the "Copying" file. In this case, the license contained in this file is valid for source codes within the directory in which it is present. Moreover, the new license stored in the "Copying" file applies to source files in child directories.

## U++ Resources

More information about the framework, can be found on the official [site](https://www.ultimatepp.org). Don't forget to check our rich [documentation](https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$documentation$en-us.html).

## Examples

### GUI

Below is the code of trivial GUI application that displays "Hello World" string inside window:

```c++
#include <CtrlLib/CtrlLib.h>

class MyApp: public Upp::TopWindow {
public:
    MyApp()
    {
        Title("My application").Zoomable().Sizeable().SetRect(0, 0, 320, 200);
    }

    void Paint(Upp::Draw& w) override
    {
        w.DrawRect(GetSize(), Upp::SWhite);
        w.DrawText(10, 10, "Hello, world!", Upp::Arial(30), Upp::Magenta);
    }
};

GUI_APP_MAIN
{
    MyApp().Run();
}
```

### TheIDE

Standard part of U++ framework is integrated development environment, TheIDE.

## Learning materials

### Tutorials

We prepared several tutorials that will allow you to learn most of the aspects of our integrated development environment, TheIDE and the U++ framework.

TheIDE:
- [**Getting started with TheIDE**](https://www.ultimatepp.org/app$ide$GettingStarted$en-us.html) - the introduction to the concepts of TheIDE.
- [TheIDE beginner guide](https://www.ultimatepp.org/app$ide$Guide_en-us.html) - continuation provides information how to solve common problems.

U++ framework:
- [**Core Tutorial**](https://www.ultimatepp.org/srcdoc$Core$Tutorial$en-us.html) - the introduction to the foundations behind the framework.
- [**GUI Tutorial**](https://www.ultimatepp.org/srcdoc$CtrlLib$Tutorial$en-us.html) - learn how to build graphical user interfaces with the U++.
- [Draw Tutorial](https://www.ultimatepp.org/srcdoc$Draw$DrawTutorial$en-us.html) - get knowledge about drawing custom content inside window or control.
- [Image Tutorial](https://www.ultimatepp.org/srcdoc$Draw$ImgTutorial$en-us.html) - check out the mechanism behind the image manipulation.
- [Network Tutorial](https://www.ultimatepp.org/srcdoc$Core$NetworkTutorial_en-us.html) - learn how to use U++ core components for network application creation.
- [Sql Tutorial](https://www.ultimatepp.org/srcdoc$Sql$tutorial$en-us.html) - introduction to using databases within U++ framework

If the above list is not enough, please visit a dedicated [website](https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$Tutorials$en-us.html) where we have collected links to most of the learning resources.

### Books

If you are looking for books about the U++ framework, here is a list of books we recommend:
- [**Getting started with the U++ Framework**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQHX84VZ/) - the book written by Frederik Dumarey and reviewed by the main authors of U++. It is an excellent starting point for anyone new to the framework. Also, if you are an experienced U++ developer, you will find much valuable content, including a deep dive into Skylark and Turtle.

## Extensibility

The functionality of the U++ framework can be easily extended by third-party packages. We introduced the concept of a global registry of repositories that can be downloaded and directly used in the project. To learn more about this technology, please visit [UppHub](https://github.com/ultimatepp/UppHub) repository.

UppHub conceptually is very similar to the package manager concept known from other technologies, and in big generalization, it can be called like that.

## Repository

### Repository layout

The U++ repository is divided into several directories. The most important ones are:
* **autotest** - unit and integration tests for our framework
* **examples** - exemplary codes of complex applications
* **references** - reference examples demonstrating individual features of U++
* **tutorial** - exemplary code from our tutorials
* **uppsrc** - main sources of the framework
