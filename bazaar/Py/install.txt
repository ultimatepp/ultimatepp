to make python work in upp there are few steps to do..

WINDOWS

go to the python page 
http://www.python.org/getit/

and choose the installer for windows, version 2.7.1 is good and current.
linux should have python 2.7.1 already shipped.

the windows installer will put it in 'C:\Python27' folder

setup your build method for windows to add to PATH:
C:\Python27
to INCLUDE
C:\Python27\include
to LIB
C:\Python27\
C:\Python27\libs
C:\Python27\DLLs

again, linux should already have python available from start.
for more linux info see below.

make sure NOT to choose DEBUG compile, since it will fail. the reason:
python27 headers need some more functions in debug mode, which are not provided in release lib.
but the Upp Python package is ready to be used as DEBUG as well. if needed, read on.

COMPILING IN THE IDE
python only applications (without BOOSTPY flag) can compile with MSC and GCC
in debug with all shared and with BLITZ. release should work with MSC without BLITZ.
(both debug and release with all configs, static, shared libs and allshared)
BOOTSPY: boost demands the use of shared libs. boostpro precompiled libs are MSC only.

DEBUG:
debug is needed, when you need to debug at least *your* application. so you will need
the target library for DEBUG, named python27_d.dll / python27_d.so respectively.

for linux, download the python debug package which should be available for your distro
or recompile it from source with the needed flags for configure.

for windows you will need to compile it from source, because, it is not provided in installation.
download the sources at same location or directly
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/Python-2.7.1.tgz
extract and move the Python-2.7.1 folder with the sources to C:\

go to C:\Python-2.7.1\PCbuild
and open the pcbuild.sln with VisualStudio 2008, or express, should do as well.
do a 'build solution', which will fail in some packages, ssl and the like. no matter..

PCbuild folder will contain the files
	python27_d.dll
	python27_d.lib
	python27_d.pdb
	python27_d.exp

copy the dll to C:\Python27
and the remaining 3 files to C:\Python27\libs

this should enable you to compile your app as DEBUG..

NOTE:
for shorthand, use the provided precompiled python27_d

NOTE:
normally, it should be enough to set all the paths and no need to specify the libs to link
in the package organizer. but in conjungtion with python boost lib it crashes in quite arbitrary
parts. also, the boost python headers need to go first, before any upp stuff, since it defines
and uses the t_ macro. which should be considered changing in upp in the future.

NOTE:
#include <Py/Py.h> and all deriving/dependant packages
should always go first in every dependency include
since it has some defines that should be processed before Core

SIDENOTE:
_Py_NoneStruct reference errors when linking result due to Py_ENABLE_SHARED beeing undefined in pyport.h

BOOST:
Py package is prepared to be used with Boost Python, just add BOOSTPY to your compile configuration

Boost Installation:
esiest way is to download the boostpro installer
http://www.boostpro.com/download/
selct during installation MSC9 derivates (or respective your compiler) and, best, all the variants, shared, multi threaded, etc.
enhance your build method paths
PATH: C:\Prpgram Files\boost\boost_1_46_1\bin and C:\Prpgram Files\boost\boost_1_46_1\lib
INCLUDE C:\Prpgram Files\boost\boost_1_46_1
LIB: C:\Prpgram Files\boost\boost_1_46_1\lib
Boostpro provides only MSC compiled libs. gcc/mingw compiled libs have to be generated manually.
see the build procedure at boost.org

BOOST CAVEAT
see point 8 at
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/libs/python/doc/building.html
the boost libraries from boostpro come with release and debug variants linked to python27.dll both
(the debug should theoretically be linked to python27_d)
when compiling release, all is fine, but compiling debug can render the executable unusable,
since it loads both python27.dll through the boost.python lib, and the python27_d.dll through
the pragma comment(lib,) which results in mixed inits and crashes/access violations.
not even the BOOST_DEBUG_PYTHON define seems to help here, since it seems to be provided
during build of the boost python libs to instruct them proper linkage.

thats why it is the esiest way to control manually, which lib is going to be included manually.
#define MS_NO_COREDLL 1
#define Py_ENABLE_SHARED 1
are to disable the pragma comment(lib,) stuff so we manually can specify the libs while preserving all shared stuff.

LINUX

there is so far no easy way to make linkage easy in linux. but you should be familiar 
with the compile/link process in linux anyway. in pakcage configuration 
add the respective lib, i.e. 'python2.7'. static linking stuff is found in /usr/lib/python/config, typically.
do not compile all static, this does'nt work well, it will need a lot other satic dependencies, like gtk.
boost will also require you to build shared or all shared.
you definitely will need to add '/usr/include/python' to your include paths in the build method.
boost will complain, if not.

boost will need to add the 'boost_python' lib or 'boost_python-mt' lib for MT compile,
