Urr - UDP request-response protocol
============

Motivation: To provide simple effective by reliable protocol for request-response,
where both request and response are usually (but not required to) small text messages, <8KB.

Urr can handle request-response situation using only two datagram, in ideal situation,
while adding security to UDP, which can handle lost, delayed or duplicated datagrams and
response messages longer than 8KB. (It also, as an option, provides one-way messages without
security).

In following, data structres are described using C; all data are in little-endian architecture,
word is 16 bit word, Uuid is 16 bytes unique identificator (random generated with high quality
random generator).

Request:

Header:

struct UrrRequestHdr {
	Uuid        id;         // unique identifier of request
	byte        version;    // now 0
	byte        flags;      // bit flags - now can be 0 or URR_ONEWAY (0x01)
	word        blksize;    // maximum length of one datagram in response (default 8000)
};

The only allowed option in flags so far is URR_ONEWAY (0x01) - it instructs server not to
send the response (avoids security).

Header is followed by request, size of request is limited by maximum UDP datagram size
(safe bet is 8000 bytes).

Response:

Header:

struct UrrResponseHdr {
	Uuid        id;
	int         part;
};

id has the value from UrrRequestHdr; this assures that client can distiguish the correct
response (e.g. if some datagrams get duplicated and/or delayed).

part designates the meaing of datagram. It can be positive index of block or one of

URR_LAST       = -1, // this is the last datagram of response
URR_FIN        = -2, // finalizing multi-datagram response
URR_SINGLE     = -3, // this is single datagram response
URR_PROCESSING = -4, // server is still processing the request, retry later

Protocol:

In the most common case, when reponse fits the single datagram and no timeout (e.g. packed lost)
is involved, all the request response consists of two datagrams. Server response with URR_SINGLE,
client only checks the match of 'id' and roundtrip is finished.

If client does not recieve the response in defined time, it repeats the request. 'id' will make
sure that server does not process the request again (server stores all request ids 10 seconds back).

If response is longer than 'blksize' of request, things get complicated, as response has to be split
into more parts. Server graduallty sends datagrams with 'part' equal 0, 1, 2, ....

Client acknowledges every part by sending the content of UrrResponseHdr back (without the data).

The last datagram has 'part' = URR_LAST, this gets acknowledged too.

If client fails to recieve the correct part of sequence (datagram lost or timeout), it sends back
the acknowledge of last good datagramm - this will make server to restart from that point.

After URR_LAST server sends one last URR_FIN to make client aware that acknowledge was not lost
(otherwise client has to send it again). If URR_FIN is lost, client repeats sending URR_LAST
acknowledge and server ignores them - lost URR_FIN has performance impact on client, but it is not
an error (reason: it is better to stall the client rather than server).

More about server:

Server in principle stores last 10 seconds (adjustable default) requests based on Uuid and response to them.
It is also possible that server application for some kind of requests tells the server not to store response
(e.g. if response does not change the server) - in that case repeated request is performed again.

Server also can store response responses of last second (adjustable). That is because in input queue there can
be repeated request while it is processed. Therefore server would response more times. Server also
stores requests known to being processed - if these requests repeat, server responds with URR_PROCESSING.
Client should interpret this as more waiting for result is required.
