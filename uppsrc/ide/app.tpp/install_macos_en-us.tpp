[s1; U`+`+ macOS installation&]
[s3; After downloading the archive, unpack it and in terminal, invoke 
./install script. If you do not have commandline toolchain installed, 
the script should invoke the standard GUI installation of these 
(you have to wait for installation to finish before proceeding).&]
[s3; Additionally, U`+`+ needs openssl library and automatically 
installs Homebrew package manager (if it is not installed yet) 
and uses it to install openssl.&]
[s3; As long as you keep [*/ theide ](or [*/ umk]) just in the original 
directory, nothing will be written outside of it `- its `"sandboxed`". 
If you get bored with U`+`+ and need to clean the space, simply 
delete the `"upp`" folder.&]
[s3; If you move theide e.g. to [/ `~/bin], it will start to write 
things to[/  `~/.config ]and [/ `~/.cache].&]
