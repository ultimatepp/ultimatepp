REJECTED as we are going to use clang:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7372388/determine-whether-a-program-is-running-under-wine-at-runtime
- Mingw: Release mode theide crash, symptom missing doc points
- Mingw compiled theide, TestChStyle, breakpoint 699 ChWin32.cpp - no info about local variables (also in Console, seems consistent)
- runtime .dll (?) - UCRT is OK for now
