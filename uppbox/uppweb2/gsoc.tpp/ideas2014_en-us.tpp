[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 Google Summer of Code 2014 has been announced and this year 
Ultimate`+`+ project really wants to participate as a mentoring 
organization. ]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 If you like C`+`+ and you want to use a radical focus to more 
effective programming we would be happy if you come with us.]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 Here we will describe you our proposals. We hope you will like 
them! However you can ask for additional information and we would 
also like to hear your ideas.]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 You can introduce yourself in our ][^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/^2 F
orum][2 , discuss with the community these ideas and your proposals 
adding your personal touches. You can also contact the ][^topic`:`/`/uppweb`/gsoc`/mentor2014`$en`-us^2 m
entors][2  whose skills can match with your project ideas. This 
way you can do your own proposals with more possibilities to 
be approved.]&]

[s0; [* U`+`+ Independent Audio Module]&]

[s0; [*2 Proposed by]&]
[s0; [2 Zbigniew Rębacz (Student)]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [*2 Difficulty]&]
[s0; [2 Hard]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [*2 Required skills/knowledge]&]
[s0; [2 C`+`+, C, minimal U`+`+ knowledge, debugging, low`-level programing, 
understanding somebody`'s code, reading `& understanding documentation, 
creating multiplatform code.]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [*2 Expected result]&]
[s0; [2 U`+`+ audio module works on multiple operating system such 
as Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD. But, we will be happy 
if the code will work at least on two platforms.]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [*2 Brief Explanation]&]
[s0; [2 U`+`+ currently handle audio only with other high level libraries 
for instance SDL. The main task is to create independent module. 
To achieve this you will need to use low level API for each operating 
system which U`+`+ supports such as WinAPI or ALSA.]&]

Individual widgets gain support for this API.]&]
[s0;# &]
[s0;# [*2 Brief Explanation]&]
[s0;# [2 U`+`+ currently only supports input using mouse and keyboard. 
The task here is to add virtual methods to Ctrl class to support 
touch screens and to detect and support a common list of touch 
gestures. Default implementations of virtual methods might convert 
these gestures to mouse events for sort of backward compatibility. 
Once the touch API is implemented, it would be possible to add 
relevant behaviour to U`+`+ widgets.]&]

other engines might be used as well.]&]
