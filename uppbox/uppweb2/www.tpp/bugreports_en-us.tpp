[s2; Bug reports and patch submission&]
[s3; Reporting bugs&]
[s5; If you feel that something does not work as it should, the most 
effective way how to proceed is to post a message in the [^http`:`/`/ultimatepp`.org`/forums^ f
orum]. The usual ethics apply here the same way as on most of 
the forums all over the Internet: Before posting, [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/index`.php`?t`=search`&^ c
heck] if the problem isn`'t already reported. Please, make sure 
that you are posting in the correct forum section. If you experience 
a problem with the library, make sure to post in [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/index`.php`?t`=index`&cat`=16`&^ U
`+`+ Library support]. Problems with TheIDE should be reported 
to [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/index`.php`?t`=index`&cat`=10`&^ U`+`+
 TheIDE]. Note that some sections have sticky posts, please read 
them before posting, they usually contain important information.&]
[s5; You should always provide the information about your system, 
as it often helps when reproducing your problem. Usually writing 
down the version of U`+`+, your operating system and compiler 
are enough. If the problem is TheIDE related, include also the 
version of TheIDE `- it can be found in the About`-box (Assist 
> About ...). In some special cases we might ask for more details 
if it is necessary.&]
[s5; Also, please [*/ DO NOT] post bugs to [*/ Bugs (`& fixes)] forum 
directly. Use the category best describing your problem, they 
will be moved later if necessary.&]
[s5; Whenever possible, please add a simple piece of code (a `"[*/ test 
case]`") that demonstrates the problem which you report. When 
the developers know how to reproduce the problem, there is a 
much higher probability that fix will be released soon. In simple 
words, problem reproduced is usually a problem solved. If the 
test case is single file only, just paste the code into the forum 
post. If it is more complex, you can use .zip attachment.&]
[s5; One picture is worth a thousand words, as the old saying goes. 
If you experience any kind of rendering problems, including a 
[*/ screenshot] helps very much and saves you some typing.&]
[s3; Submitting patches&]
[s5; If you find a bug and you also happen to be capable of solving 
it, we would be very thankful if you post your solution. The 
same also applies if you find a solution to the bug reported 
by someone else.&]
[s5; If the patch changes only a small part of the code, the preferred 
method is to post only changed functions or classes in the post 
text. To make it easier for people reviewing the patch, you should 
also write in which files the changed code resides. If there 
are more files affected, the best is to simply post all changed 
files in .zip as attachment.&]
[s5; You can generate `*.diff or `*.patch file by only using Git. 
Please notice, that firstly you need to checkout repository. 
More information about whole process you can find in
[^https`:`/`/`github`.com`/ultimatepp`/ultimatepp`/^2 GitHub]].]]
