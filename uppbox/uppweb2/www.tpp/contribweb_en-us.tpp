[s1; How to contribute `- web page&]
[s2; Thanks to your help U`+`+ web page is getting better, more complete 
and translated. Here we show you the ways how you can help.&]
[s3; Basic help&]
[s2; If you are new in U`+`+ and do not know how to use [^topic`:`/`/ide`/app`/Topic`$en`-us^ T
`+`+] you still can help.&]
[s2; Post your translations, fixes and patches or propose new pages 
in U`+`+ [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/^ Forum]. Be 
sure they will be acknowledged and somebody will upload them 
for you.&]
[s3; Advanced help&]
[s2; These are the steps to upload your changes.&]
[s2; [* Access to U`+`+ GIT version control system]&]
[s2; To begin you will need the latest sources from [^https`:`/`/github`.com`/ultimatepp`/ultimatepp`/^ G
itHub].&]
[s2;l128;i150;O0; Open the packages where you want to enter the changes:&]
[s2;l256;i150;O0; uppbox/uppweb&]
[s2;l256;i150;O0; uppsrc/Core&]
[s2;l256;i150;O0; ...&]
[s2;l128;i150;O0; Edit .tpp files using [^topic`:`/`/ide`/app`/Topic`$en`-us^ T`+`+]&]
[s2;l128;i150;O0; Finally make a PR with your changes to U`+`+&]
[s2; Please do not modify contents made by other directly. It is 
better first to recommend the changes and ask for permission.&]
[s2; After that the day after you will see the web page updated. 
The secret of this is that U`+`+ hosting system will compile 
and run uppweb package converting this index package and your 
T`+`+ help system into .html web pages.&]
[s2; [* If nothing works]&]
[s2; If nothing works or you do not feel comfortable in doing this 
you can send a post to [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/^ Forum] 
asking for help or just send [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/index`.php`?t`=usrinfo`&id`=648`&^ m
