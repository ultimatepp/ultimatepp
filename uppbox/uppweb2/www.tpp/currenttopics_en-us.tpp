[s2; Current Topics&]
[s3; Introduction&]
[s4; Ultimate`+`+ project is in continuous improvement both from 
core developers and community. The interest areas cover bug fixes 
and new developments. &]
[s4; This list is a work`-in`-progress. You can follow discussions 
in [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/^ Forum].&]
[s3; New developments&]
[s5; U`+`+ port to Mac OS and mobile devices (Android `& iOS)&]
[s4; Now, Ultimate`+`+ works nicely on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and MS 
Windows. However there is an important number of people using 
other operating systems and cannot enjoy U`+`+. Some efforts 
are being done nowadays:&]
[s4;l192;i150;O0; [* Mac OS]&]
[s4;l320; You can follow posts in Forum in [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/index`.php`?t`=thread`&frm`_id`=90`&^ D
eveloping U`+`+ >> Mac OSX]. The efforts are leaded by [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/index`.php`?t`=usrinfo`&id`=761`&^ R
eini]. In brief, we need to fully port CtrlCore and CtrlLib to 
Cocoa.&]
[s4;l192;i150;O0; [* Android]&]
[s4;l352; Currently, we manage to create [^topic`:`/`/ide`/app`/AndroidBuilder`$en`-us^ A
ndroid builder] for TheIDE. It allows us to targeting build for 
this platform by using the Android SDK and NDK.&]
[s4;l352; Moreover, we partially port Core for Android. There are 
several issues like lack of locals support.&]
[s4;l352; In the future we plan to port CtrlCore and CtrlLib to allows 
programmers to write applications for Android by using U`+`+ 
framework. The port might not be enough here. Probably, we should 
improved CtrlLib by several mobiles concepts like:&]
[s4;l512;i150;O1; Layout containers (VerticalLayout, GridLayout etc.)&]
[s4;l512;i150;O1; Touch gesture support.&]
[s4;l352; We are strongly interested in testing our currently infrastructure. 
We need to make sure that everything we achieved in this area 
works stable as possible.&]
[s4;l160;i150;O0; [* iOS]&]
[s4;l320;~~~192; Firstly, we need to finish our Mac OS port.&]
[s5; Serial devices&]
[s4; There is a strong interest in including a complete and portable 
serial port support. Follow the advances in [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/^ F
orum ]mainly in this [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forums`/index`.php`?t`=msg`&th`=1124`&start`=0`&^ t
hread].&]
[s5; Web development&]
[s4; In recent years, we created several useful web developments 
tools. Our jewel in the crown is [^topic`:`/`/srcdoc`/Skylark`/Tutorial`$en`-us^ Sk
ylark] that allows to development web application. On the other 
hand we have got Turtle. It is tiny HTML5/JS client that allows 
to run U`+`+ GUI application directly in the web browser.&]
[s4; In this area we definitely needs improvement in TheIDE space. 
It should allows to launch web page when web package is executing. 
Moreover in both packages not every element works as we expected. 
Simply, it means that there are several bugs that we wanted to 
fix.&]
[s5; Distributed computing&]
[s4; Support for interprocess and inter`-computer communication. 
Services or objects or whatever can reside on different computers 
and still form the single program. &]
[s4; It is well defined what Distributed Computing is. However one 
of the main efforts is to design how to integrate distributed 
computing with U`+`+ design philosophy.&]
[s5; Documentation&]
[s4; Documentation is by definition a work`-in`-process as coding. 
Areas to be improved would be:&]
[s4;l160;i150;O0; Classes and functions documentation.&]
[s4;l160;i150;O0; Look standardization and improvement.&]
[s4;l160;i150;O0; U`+`+ web pages look could be more standard and 
sometimes it seems old fashioned. Upp web could be benefited 
with a style refurbishing thus maintaining the actual structure 
and being compatible with U`+`+ `"T`+`+ help system to html`" 
technology.&]
[s4;l160;i150;O0; Translation.&]
[s4;l160;i150;O0; Functions and classes reference translation is 
not a priority. However to translate the main project pages where 
U`+`+ advantages are described could help to spread the project 
to a wider audience.&]
[s4;l160;i150;O0; Controls in Layout Designer.&]
[s4;l160;i150;O0; Sometimes the best documentation is to have the 
right control in front of you. Most of controls are accessible 
in Layout Designer but some controls not. And a control that 
is not in the Layout Designer is like it would not exist.&]
[s5; Improving TheIDE usability for new users&]
[s4; U`+`+ is a new paradigm in programming and TheIDE is the standard 
bearer. However U`+`+ new users sometimes found difficulties 
in using this powerful tool. Because it TheIDE usability has 
to be studied and improved.]]
