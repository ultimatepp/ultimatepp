[s2; Installing U`+`+ on Ubuntu&]
[s5; &]
[s0; The U`+`+ packages for Ubuntu are available on [^https`:`/`/launchpad`.net`/^ Laun
chpad.net], both for [^https`:`/`/launchpad`.net`/`~dolik`-rce`/`+archive`/upp^ sta
ble releases] and [^https`:`/`/launchpad`.net`/`~dolik`-rce`/`+archive`/upp`-nightly^ n
ightly builds]. This guide explains how to add the PPA (Personal 
Package Archive) to your system and install U`+`+ sources and 
TheIDE from there.&]
[s0; &]
[s3;H0; Installing stable release packages&]
[s0; &]
[s0; To start using any software from a PPA, you first need to tell 
Ubuntu where to find the PPA. For Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) and later 
this is really easy (see note below for instruction for older 
systems). To add the stable PPA to your system, just execute 
following command in terminal:&]
[s0; &]
[s7; sudo add`-apt`-repository ppa:dolik`-rce/upp&]
[s0; &]
[s0; This will add the PPA to your sources.list as well as download 
the gpg keys that are used to ensure authenticity of packages 
when installing. &]
[s0; &]
[s0;l416; [@(102) Note: On older (pre 9.10 Karmic) Ubuntu systems there 
is no add`-apt`-repository command, so the first step is little 
bit more complicated. First of all, you must manually add the 
repository information to /etc/apt/sources.list. To do so, open 
this file in a text editor (here gedit is usedd, but can be replaced 
with any other editor `- e.g. nano, mousepad, ...):]&]
[s0;l416;@(102) &]
[s7;l640; sudo gedit /etc/apt/source.list&]
[s0;l416;@(102) &]
[s0;l416; [@(102) This will open a text editor containing the list 
of archives that your system is currently using. Scroll to the 
bottom of the file and paste in these two lines:]&]
[s0;l416;@(102) &]
[s7;l640; [@(102) deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/dolik`-rce/upp/ubuntu 
hardy main ]&]
[s7;l640; [@(102) deb`-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/dolik`-rce/upp/ubuntu 
hardy main ]&]
[s0;l416;@(102) &]
[s0;l416; [@(102) If you use Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty, replace `"hardy`" 
with `"jaunty`". Save the file and exit the text editor.]&]
[s0;l416;@(102) &]
[s0;l416; [@(102) Now you need to add that key to your system so Ubuntu 
can verify the packages from the PPA. In your terminal, enter:]&]
[s0;l416;@(102) &]
[s7;l640; sudo apt`-key adv `-`-keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com `-`-recv`-keys 
643469F3&]
[s0;l416;@(102) &]
[s0;l416; [@(102) This will now pull down the PPA`'s key and add it 
to your system. Now the PPA is added and the rest of the instructions 
is same for all versions of Ubuntu.]&]
[s0;l416; &]
[s0; &]
[s0; The next step is to tell your system to pull down the latest 
list of software from each archive it knows about, including 
the PPA you just added:&]
[s0; &]
[s7; sudo apt`-get update&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Now we are ready to install U`+`+, by issuing the last command&]
[s0; &]
[s7; sudo apt`-get install upp&]
[s0; &]
[s0; You will be probably prompted if you want to install packages 
upp and theide, just press Y to confirm. And that`'s it, it is 
really simple, right? The U`+`+ sources are now installed in 
[@5 /usr/share/upp]. TheIDE is in [@5 /usr/bin/theide] and you should 
also see it now in your application menu (or application launcher 
or whatever it is called in your desktop environment).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Upon the first start of TheIDE you will be presented with Source 
management wizard that allows you to specify how to treat the 
sources and their updates. In default settings, the sources will 
be copied in your home directory (so you can access and modify 
them without root permissions).&]
[s0; &]
[s3;H0; Installing nightly build packages&]
[s0; &]
[s0; The procedure for installing the nightly packages is exactly 
the same as for the stable releases, the only difference is the 
address of the PPA. To install nightly PPA, replace `"[* dolik`-rce/upp]`" 
with `"[* dolik`-rce/upp`-nightly]`" everywhere in the above instructions.]]
